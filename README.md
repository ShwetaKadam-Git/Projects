# Projects
This project analyzes Iga Swiatek's match performance using a dataset containing 320 matches. It provides various insights, including summary statistics, opponent-based trends, match duration trends, and visualization of key performance metrics. The analysis is presented in an interactive Streamlit dashboard.

Features of the Project - 
1. Summary Statistics
This section provides a detailed overview of the dataset with key insights, including:
 - General Overview: Summary statistics, unique values, missing values
 - Performance Metrics: Win percentage, average winners, and unforced errors
 - Opponent-Based Insights: Best and worst opponents based on Winners/UFEs Ratio
 - Surface-Wise Performance: Analyzing performance across different court surfaces
 - Match Duration Trends: Average, longest, and shortest match durations

2️. Data Visualizations
The Data Visualizations section enables users to explore different match trends interactively. Available visualizations include:
 - Feature Correlation Heatmap – Identifies relationships between key features
 - Wins & Losses vs Opponents – Stacked bar chart showing performance against different players
 - Distribution of Winners (Histogram) – Visualizes how often winners are played
 - Boxplot of Unforced Errors – Helps analyze Iga's consistency in avoiding errors
 - Win/Loss Heatmap vs Opponents – Shows win/loss distribution across different players

3. Technologies Used
